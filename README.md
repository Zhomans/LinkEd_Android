LinkEd
==============

LinkEd is a Android application designed to fundamentally alter parent's interaction with their children's school life. According to interviews we conducted, parents have a difficult time connecting with their children when it comes to school because children are less than forthcoming about what they have learned each day. By providing that information to parents in a quick and simple way, parents no longer need ask the same questions every day and can instead ask more thoughtful ones, which can lead to meaningful conversations and new interactions between parents and children.

Please note that this application is only the parent's side of this system.

To use, run on an Android phone or through an emulator. When prompted for an ID, enter either 1, 2, or 3.
